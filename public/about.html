  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm a software developer with a passion for building smart, efficient solutions through code. 
    I specialize in software development and am currently expanding my skill set by studying web development — adding 
    more tools to my digital toolbox.</p>
  
  <h2>My Journey</h2>  
  <p>Technology has always fascinated me — how it shapes our lives, connects people, and solves real-world problems. 
    My journey into software development started with a curiosity to understand how things work behind the screen. Over time, 
    that curiosity turned into a career built on continuous learning and practical problem-solving.
    Now, I'm diving into the world of web development to create seamless, user-friendly experiences on the web. 
    I believe that combining strong software fundamentals with modern web skills is key to building future-ready applications.</p>
  
  <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>
  <p>Right now, I'm focused on sharpening my front-end and back-end web development skills, exploring frameworks, 
    and working on personal projects that bring ideas to life. Whether it's a new app, a useful tool, 
    or a website that makes an impact — I'm all in.</p>
  
  <h2>Let's Connect</h2>  
  <p>If you're interested in collaborating, have a project in mind, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out. 
    I'm always open to new ideas, challenges, and conversations around tech and development.</p>
  
    Thanks for stopping by!
