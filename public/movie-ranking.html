        <h1>The Best Movies According to Darlington</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>The Bourne Identity</h3>
        <p>
            This is my favourite Action movie of all time. I love the the way the movie builds up.<br />
            Unlike the flashy and gadget-heavy Bond films of the time, The Bourne Identity took a more grounded,<br />
            realistic approach. It emphasized raw, tactical intelligence and physicality over tech and glamor.<br /> 
            That felt fresh and more relatable.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>My Cousin Vinny</h3>
        <p>
            The humor in My Cousin Vinny comes from character-driven situations, not cheap gags.<br /> 
            Joe Pesci’s fast-talking Vinny and Marisa Tomei’s no-nonsense Mona Lisa Vito are hilarious, but never cartoonish.<br /> 
            The comedy feels natural, even during high-stakes courtroom moments.<br />
        </p>
        <h3>The Bourne Ultimatum</h3>
        <p>
            The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) is often hailed as the best entry in the Bourne series—and one of the greatest modern<br /> 
            action thrillers—for several compelling reasons. It brought together everything that made the first two films work<br /> 
            and elevated them to a peak level of execution. From the opening frame, The Bourne Ultimatum never slows down.<br /> 
            The film moves with surgical precision—jumping from one location to another with urgency but never confusion.<br /> 
            The editing (which won an Oscar) keeps the tension high without sacrificing clarity.<br />
